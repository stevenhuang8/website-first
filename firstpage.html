            <h2>About Steven Huang</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Steven Huang. I am 22 years old. I was born and raised in San Diego, California.
                I have three older siblings: Kevin, Danny, Michelle. They are aged, respectively, 34, 30, and 28.
                I am extremely proud of them because they are all very successful while still being great human beings.
                It is safe to say I look up to them and aspire to be just as successful and kind as them, if not more.
                I also have two loving parents from Taiwan: Weite Huang and Chiukuei Yu. They worked very hard to raise me
                into who I am today and I thank them for that. They moved here from Taiwan to pursue their studies and raise
                a family here. I also have a best friend named Jake Hydo. These people are who shaped me to be who I am today.

            <h2>My Career Choice</h2>
            <p>
                I plan to take the path of a software engineer because it piques my interest of what can be accomplished with it.
                The ability to take data and enhance the process of creating a commodity or being able to enhance generative AI and its
                several capabilities. The plethora of choices with this career choice piques my curiosity of what else I could possibly do
                with software engineering. I made the mistake of having a major in marketing intially when I first entered college, realizing I wanted to
                code, I attempted to switch to computer science as a major, but I failed. I have then switched to a major in Information Systems and have
                learned several languages to create several projects. I am excited for what is to come.

            <h2>My life from early college and how I have grown</h2>
            <p>
                My college life. I went into college as a rather naive and some what of a people-pleaser. I feel I am still optimistic, but to a certain extent.
                As for the people pleasing aspect, I feel I do not do it as much anymore, but I still notice it comes up every now and then. I would like to focus more
                on my career now rather than go out and party. In fact, partying gives me anxiety when I feel like I should be working. I feel that I have a good mix of
                working and having my time to relax and socialize. My social awareness and hard-working nature are amicable with each other and I hope to succeed and go far
                in this world.
